# AITSYS GO CLI Tools

Cross-platform helpers for creating and managing AITSYS GO short links. Every operation uses the Worker API; Wrangler and a local repository checkout are not required.

## Setup

Set the API base and key. Use an issued account token with `short`, and the master administrator token with `short-admin`:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AITSYS_SHORT_API_BASE", "https://go.aitsys.dev", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AITSYS_SHORT_API_KEY", "<api-key>", "User")
```

Open a new terminal after setting the variable. Add this folder to `PATH` if you want to run the commands from anywhere.

On Linux:

```bash
export AITSYS_SHORT_API_BASE=https://go.aitsys.dev
export AITSYS_SHORT_API_KEY='<api-key>'
```

Linux requires `curl` and `jq`. Clipboard copying additionally uses `wl-copy`, `xclip`, or `xsel` when available.

## Commands

Create a random short link for the current GitHub repository:

```powershell
short
```

Useful options:

```powershell
short -NoClipboard
short -ExpiresIn 7d
short -ExpiresAt "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z"
short -SuppressSocialPreview
short -DestinationUrl "https://example.com" -Creator "AITSYS" -Title "Example"
```

Open the interactive admin tool:

```powershell
short-admin
```

List links:

```powershell
short-admin -List
```

List issued user-token records and their IDs, account IDs, optional labels, creation dates, and active/revoked state:

```powershell
short-admin -ListTokens
```

Native Bash equivalents include `short-admin list-links`, `short-admin list-tokens`, `short-admin list-accounts`, and the account/token management commands shown by `short-admin --help`.

All admin operations use the authenticated Worker API. Global link and token enumeration requires the master administrator key. Complete issued tokens are never stored or retrieved; token listings intentionally omit both the complete token and its SHA-256 digest. Link listings can report that password protection is enabled, but the API and tools never return or print a link password or its verifier.
