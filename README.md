# AITSYS Go

AITSYS Go is a privacy-first, multi-user link shortener built on Cloudflare Workers. It shows people where a short link leads before redirecting them and does not collect click analytics, use cookies, or serve advertising.

It provides:

- a versioned REST API with account-scoped, revocable user tokens;
- a small web redirector with optional previews, passwords, and expiry;
- creation-focused Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox extensions;
- an Android 10+ share target and link-management app;
- a private Discord user app; and
- PowerShell and Bash tools for creating and administering links.

## Releases

Releases are built and published automatically from the `main` branch. 

Due to extension store limitations, extension zips are not signed.

If a version was submitted, we'll update the release with the signed package once it is available. Firefox provides an `.xpi` package, while Chrome and Edge provide `.crx` packages. Edge publishing remains disabled until its store review is complete.

Play Store releases are automatic. See the `publish-stores.yml` [runs](https://github.com/Aiko-IT-Systems/cloudflare-link-shortener/actions/workflows/publish-stores.yml) to get access to the app sharing link if you don't have access to the Play Store version yet.
